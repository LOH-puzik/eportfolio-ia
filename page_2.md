# Agent Communication Using KQML and KIF

## Assignment Overview

This assignment explores agent communication within multi-agent systems through the practical application of two foundational communication standards: Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML) and Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF). The work demonstrates how autonomous software agents coordinate and share information in distributed artificial intelligence environments, addressing fundamental challenges in enabling heterogeneous systems to communicate effectively.

## The Scenario

The assignment presents a realistic warehouse management dialogue between two agents: Alice, an autonomous procurement agent responsible for inventory acquisition, and Bob, a warehouse management agent controlling stock levels and product specifications. Through this scenario, the dialogue illustrates how agents query information, respond to requests, and coordinate decision-making processes that mirror real-world supply chain operations.

## What is KQML and KIF?

KQML serves as the communication protocol layer, providing standardised message structures called performatives that express communicative intent. These performatives—such as `ask-one` for requesting single answers, `ask-all` for comprehensive queries, and `tell` for asserting facts—derive from speech act theory in linguistics and philosophy. KQML enables agents to structure conversations through parameters that specify senders, receivers, conversation identifiers, and ontological contexts.

KIF complements KQML by providing formal content representation based on first-order predicate logic. Whilst KQML defines how agents communicate, KIF specifies what they communicate, enabling precise knowledge exchange through logical predicates, variables, and relationships. This separation between communication protocol and content language provides modularity and flexibility in agent system design.

## Key Concepts Explored

The assignment thoroughly examines the motivations driving agent-based computing, including autonomy, decentralisation, interoperability, and knowledge sharing. It analyses how standardised communication languages enable heterogeneous systems to coordinate despite differences in implementation technologies or internal knowledge representations.

The work provides comprehensive coverage of contemporary agent architectures, including reactive agents that respond directly to environmental stimuli, deliberative agents that employ symbolic reasoning and planning, and the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework that models practical reasoning. The assignment traces these models to their theoretical foundations in artificial intelligence research, connecting practical implementation to decades of knowledge representation and reasoning research.

Additionally, the assignment discusses the evolution from KQML to modern standards like FIPA-ACL, acknowledging both historical contributions and contemporary developments in multi-agent systems. It addresses real-world applications spanning supply chain management, e-commerce platforms, and smart grid systems, demonstrating the practical relevance of agent communication research beyond theoretical interest.

## Learning Outcomes Addressed

This work directly addresses the module's learning outcomes by demonstrating understanding of agent-based computing motivations, current agent models, and their grounding in artificial intelligence research. The detailed message analysis, architectural discussions, and connections to speech act theory and knowledge representation research showcase the theoretical foundations underlying practical multi-agent systems.
