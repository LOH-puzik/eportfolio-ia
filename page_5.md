# Digital Forensics Agent: Individual Implementation

## Module Development

I implemented all four core modules following the team-designed architecture. The FileScanner class uses Python's rglob for recursive directory traversal with pattern-based matching and permission error handling. The EvidenceArchiver implements ZIP compression followed by Fernet encryption, generating SHA-256 hashes for cryptographic integrity verification. The AuditLogger uses SQLite with immediate commit operations ensuring forensic record persistence even during system failures. The SecureTransmitter implements SFTP protocol with post-transfer integrity verification.

## Code Quality and Documentation

Throughout development, I maintained strict PEP 8 compliance: four-space indentation, 79-character line limits, snake_case for functions, and PascalCase for classes. I wrote comprehensive docstrings documenting parameters and return values for each function. Inline comments explain implementation decisions rather than describing code mechanics, such as choosing SHA-256 over MD5 due to collision vulnerability concerns affecting court admissibility.

## Testing Execution

I conducted all testing phases individually. Unit tests verified each module's functionality independently, achieving 85% code coverage. Integration testing validated the complete workflow using 11 sample evidence files, completing in 0.68 seconds with successful hash verification. Performance testing confirmed stable memory usage without leaks.

## Demonstration and Results

I prepared and delivered the system demonstration showing autonomous operation: scanning 11 files, creating encrypted archives with timestamped filenames, generating unique 64-character hexadecimal hashes, and maintaining complete audit trails. The demonstration proved the BDI model's practical application to real-world forensic challenges whilst maintaining legal evidence standards.
