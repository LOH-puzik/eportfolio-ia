# Digital Forensics Agent: Group Contributions

## Problem Definition and Requirements

Our team identified the critical challenge in digital forensics: manual evidence collection processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and risk compromising chain of custody. We collectively established that automating this workflow whilst maintaining legal admissibility standards would address fundamental investigative needs.

## Architecture Design

The team collaboratively designed the system architecture using the Belief-Desire-Intention model as our theoretical foundation. We defined how beliefs (file system knowledge), desires (evidence preservation), and intentions (concrete actions) would interact to create autonomous forensic capability. This architectural decision shaped all subsequent implementation work.

We collectively identified four core modules required for comprehensive forensic workflow: File Scanner for discovery, Evidence Archiver for preservation, Audit Logger for chain of custody, and Secure Transmitter for evidence sharing. Each module's responsibilities and interfaces were defined through team discussion.

## Standards and Testing Strategy

Our group established adherence to ISO 27037 standards for digital evidence handling, ensuring legal validity. We defined testing requirements across three levels: unit testing for individual module verification, integration testing for workflow validation, and performance testing for scalability assessment. The team agreed on 85% test coverage as our quality benchmark.

These collaborative decisions established the framework enabling individual implementation whilst ensuring system components would integrate coherently and meet forensic investigation requirements. The group work provided clear specifications allowing parallel development of different modules whilst maintaining architectural consistency.
